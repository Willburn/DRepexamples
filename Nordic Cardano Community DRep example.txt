Nordic Cardano Community DRep

We follow the CIP 1694 DRep Code of Conduct V2.0. 

As an organisation we have members who will advice us on governance matters related to SPOs, 
we have members who are able to judge the different protocol parameters both network, economic, technical and governance groups 
and we will disclose our rationale on the protocol parameter votes.

Resource wise we our main DRep public face named xyz will commmitt 5 hours a month to the public debate, but as an organsation
we will ask on our members to consult and use time for this on any matters we believe we need time to deliberate.

We can be reached at nadadrep@adamail.com and we hold public townhalls every month for the nordic cardano community.

When it comes to alliances we have discussed joining an overarching cardano governance alliance of DRep, the Nordic Cardano Community 
recieves funding for its town halls through an intersect grant program, our individual members have recieved various grants in the Cardano community and if any of them are consulted on a specific topic will disclose any conflict of interest. Our policy on voting
is to consult with experts whenever we through or membership meetings are unsure on how to vote on a specific topic without further 
deliberation. We plan to cover all governance items that seems relevant to the Nordic Cardano community as part of the wider Cardano community.  We will post a minimun of 2 epochs before a vote our voting rationale as a general rule.

If you have feedback on our following of the Code of Conduct or to improve it you can reach us on our email address listed above.
